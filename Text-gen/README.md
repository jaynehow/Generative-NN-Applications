In this directory, you can see my experiments on different datasets to generate text. I tried with [work of Neitzsche](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/), Shakespease and [Dave Chappelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Chappelle). I tried to generate Standup Comedy Script by using Dave Chappelle's (one of the greatest comedians right now, BTW) Netflix specials, but the results were not satisfactory. You can see the data in `Dave Chappelle` directory.
